# Scripta – Cryptography Toolkit
Scripta is a browser-based cryptography toolkit built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a collection of classical and modern encryption methods, allowing users to experiment with different algorithms directly from their browser without any installation or backend services.

## Features
Scripta includes implementations of :
### Modern Cryptography
- AES cipher
- DES cipher
- Asymmetric encryption
- RC4 cipher
- Stream and block cipher demonstrations

### Classical Cryptography
- Caesar cipher
- Vigenère cipher
- Playfair cipher
- Rail Fence cipher
- Classical ciphers collection
### Hashing
Common hash functions like :
- MD5
- SHA-1
- SHA-256
- SHA-512
## Usage
- Download or clone the repository.
- Open index.html in any modern web browser.
- Select a cipher, input your data and key, and choose encrypt or decrypt.

Everything runs client-side for simplicity, speed, and ease of use.
## Purpose
Scripta is designed for educational purposes, cryptography demonstrations, and basic experimentation. It is not intended for securing sensitive or production-level data.
